# 202. Happy Number

标签（空格分隔）： leetcode

---

Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Example: 19 is a happy number

思路：如果有一个数字重复出现，那么一定不是Happy Number

```
class Solution(object):
	def isHappy(self, n):
		"""
		:type n: int
		:rtype: bool
		"""
		num_dict = {}
		while n not in num_dict:
			num_dict[n] = 1
			t = 0
			while n > 0:
				i = n % 10
				t = t + i * i
				n = n / 10
			n = t
			if n == 1:
				return True
		return False
```
另外一种空间复杂度只需要O(1)的方法，类似于判断循环链表的快慢指针的思想
```
class Solution(object):
	def isHappy(self, n):
		"""
		:type n: int
		:rtype: bool
		"""
		fast = slow = n
		while True:
			slow = self.getNumber(slow)
			fast = self.getNumber(self.getNumber(fast))
			if slow == fast:
				break
		if slow == 1:
			return True
		return False
		
	def getNumber(self, n):
		t = 0
		while n > 0:
			i = n % 10
			t = t + i * i
			n = n / 10
		return t
```
